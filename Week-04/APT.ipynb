    "Despite all merits that CAPM have, it is not free from critism some of which are listed above. Stephen Ross 1976 attempted to address these critics and propose `Arbitrage Pricing Theorem` (APT), which is based on the identifying various systematic risk factors, which is rather appealing in that it is not realistic to assume that single systematic risk factor affects stock returns. However, inclusion of sources of macroeconomic variable can provide us a better understanding about the stock returns. So, the main goal of APT is to improve portfolio performance by better understanding portfolio creation and evaluation. "

In parallel to this observation, we expect to have low standard deviation for `TWTR` and high one for `FB`. Yes, this is what we get, the standard deviation of `TWTR` is 14.3.
